# Python-Summer-School-Example-Code
Example code for an eight day (two hours per day), basic python, course for 4th-6th graders that I am teaching at a local elementary school.

My goal for this course is to get the kids to a point where they can start to make their own basic projects after completing this course. 

## Day 1:
    1. Hello World: Learn about print statements and strings
    2. Hello name: Learn about strings as variables, along with adding strings
    3. Hello input: learn about the input function
    Challenge: Program a conversation with pre written responses for the computer 

## Day 2:
    1. Logic basics: if, elif, and else statements
    2. Integers as variables and addition
        - Learn about how input returns a string
        - Teach on how strings and integers can't be added together
        - Teach on str() and int()
    Challenge: Make a program that asks for two integers and then returns their sum

## Day 3:
    1. Floats as variables, subtraction, multiplication and division
        - Learn about float()
    Challenge. Make a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide(not preventing division by zero))

## Day 4: 
    1. Start with turtle
        - forward & backwards
        - right & left
        - penup, pendown, and pencolor
    Challenge: Draw a box without while loops
    Challenge: Draw a letter of your name
    

## Day 5:
    1. reveiw: Draw a box without loops
    2. While loops + for loops with turtles
        - Draw a box with while loops
        - Draw a box with a for loop
        - Change angles and repetitions to draw a hexagon
        - Draw a circle
    3. Challenge: Draw an n sided polygon

## Day 6:
    1. Input + turtle (kids each do two of the three below)
        - Have the input of your user decide how big your box is
        - Have the input of your user decide how many sides your polygon has
        - Have the input of your user decide your pencolor
    Challenge: Have your turtle draw a snowflake the shape, size, and number of dendrites decided by them
    2. Lists:
        - Make and edit a shopping list
    Challenge: Have your turtle follow a list of instructions
  

## Day 7-8:
    1. Catch up on any projects that kids are behind on
    2. Kids who are caught up can work on challenges
        - make your own tic tac toe program
        - make a password for one of your other programs using input
        - make a calculator that does not let you divide by zero
        - have your turtle draw whatever cool pattern you can think of
        - have your turtle draw a cat, dog, fish, or any other animal you can think of
        - ask Lydia how to make some of your past code cleaner
